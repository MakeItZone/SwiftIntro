# SwiftIntro

*These are the Swift files for the starship Enterprise...*

er, no.

Instead they are the humble beginnings of an introduction to Swift iOS app development course, targeting 12+ year olds. The course is for small groups. Students decide on their own project and topics are introduced to enable them to build their app. The course also covers some of the wider aspects of successful software development, such as team work, source code control, design methodologies, and computer science.

The first iteration of this course was co-taught with an introduction to robotics course using Lego MindStorms. At times this was used to advantage to compare and contrast approaches- e.g. graphical, block based (Labview/NXT) vs text based development; top-down vs iterative design.

The robotics course was left to be very free form with a basic outline challenge that was brainstormed with the students: *create a 'tank' robot that has a cannon to shoot/defend itself from other robots.* Soon after a second 'buddy' bot was added. Once the basic vehicles were built coding challenges were given. They will be included in *italics* in the class notes below. Other robots (Sphero, Ollie, Parrot Jumping Spider, Makelangelo style drawbot) were bought in to discuss and explore as well.
 
These notes were written after the first few classes were taught; the exact order of topics and duration is not 100% accurate!

## Classes ##

	* that there are different kinds of requirements, e.g. business, user, customer, developer, QA, etc
	* that there may be conflicts
	* importance vs priority
